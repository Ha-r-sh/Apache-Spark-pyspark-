# Apache-Spark-pyspark-


Apache Spark is an open-source analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism.

PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. It not only allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs, but also provides the PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data in a distributed environment.

This project demonstrates the most basic functions in the pyspark library by performing an EDA on 'Netflix Subscription' dataset.
